# Supervised_ML_Comparison

This is the final project for my course COGS_118_A: Supervised Machine Learning at UCSD;

Note: I did not come up with the methologies in this paper. My project was a replica of a 2006 Cornell University study by Rich Caruana, and Alexandru Niculescu-Mizil.

The code is not published; yet my result can be found here: https://github.com/jeffrey7377/Supervised_ML_Comparison/blob/main/ML_comparison_final_paper.pdf
